INFO:

This is a project I'm working on related to the A Level Maths Large Data Set.

It is a guide by example to using the pandas module in Python 3.12.whoknows.
I have assumed that you have an elementary knowledge of Python, so if you don't,
there are some excellent courses online. By elementary, I mean you need to have 
an understanding of the syntax, loops, varibles, and later on probably other stuff, 
which I'll add here once it's required.

Prerequisites (NOT AN INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR THE PREREQUISITES):
As stated, this is not an installation guide. Other people can and have done them 
better than I'll ever be able to. Google how to install them if needed.

Python 3.x.x
Pandas
Pyarrow (as of 09/02/24 this is not needed, but pandas is going to be dependent on it
        from the next version on)
Some form of IDE or source code editor (IDLE, Notepad or VS Code will be fine, but VS
                                        itself is just too heavy for this kind of thing.
                                        Not worth the effort. If you aren't very familiar
                                        with coding, just use IDLE (search for it on your
                                        PC)
Git (only if you want to clone this repo)

Instructions:

Read this, then go through each example from 1 onwards, CHRONOLOGICALLY. I cannot
stress the importance of doing this chronologically (unless you've used pandas, in
which case, something like w3schools would be better).
Follow the lead of each example for your data set. If you want to download and run 
the examples, please feel free to do this (you can either google downloading from
GitHub or clone the repo, depending on how much you've used git).

NOTE FOR DOWNLOADERS:
If you download this, either change the file paths in the source code to where you have
the folder "LDS" (included in the repo) or move the folder to the following path:
      "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop"
if it exists. If it doesn't, just change the paths in the code. It'll be way less hassle.

Licencey type stuff:

I don't have the time nor the energy to read licences. So, here's the deal: 

      Do what you want with this. But do good stuff. And credit this repo using the link:
        "https://github.com/SnailMail500/Pandas-Guide"
      So that means:
      Feel free to adapt this to other data. 
      Feel free to add stuff to it (not on this repo, fork it or clone and make a new one)
      Feel free to add issues where I've screwed up.

      BUT:
      IF you change this, credit me. All I want if you improve this is credit to me for making
      the original. This includes forks of forks etc.

Cool? Good. 

NOTICE:

This particular guide uses a publically available past data set for educational 
purposes. Please drop me a message if you want credit or if you want me to change
part of it for whatever reason. I'll be happy to oblige any reasonable requests.
